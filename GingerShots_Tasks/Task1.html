    You'll see everything you need to know on the label. Only two ingredients. Organic ginger juice + organic apple juice. That means no preservatives, no additives, nothing watering down our cold pressed organic ginger shot.
    
    We think that whole 'apple a day' thing is pretty great, but maybe they were missing something. The second you take a gulp of pure ginger extract mixed with fresh, organic apple juice, you'll know what we're talking about. Ginger and apple is an unbeatable combination.
